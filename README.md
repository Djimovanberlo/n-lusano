Hello there! My name is Nausicaa:sparkles:, and I recently graduated from [Codaisseur Academy](https://codaisseur.com/) as _Junior Full-stack Developer_. :nerd_face:
I had no previous experience, but coding has always been a huge interest and a lifelong dream, and I finally took the courage to pursue it; thinking back, I have come a long way from being that teenager who devised countless "templates" to customize friends' blogs (because pre-made themes are boring, I think we can all agree on that :grin:), and I can't wait to see what else the future holds! In the meantime, I'm putting everything I learned so far to good use, focusing on exercising and always learning :seedling: and getting ready to enter the development field, as I'm currently looking for a full-time opportunity.

Feel free to reach out! :wave:
